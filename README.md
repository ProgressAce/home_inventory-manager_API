# Home Inventory-Manager API

A Backend API that manages the inventory of a household. It allows a household to keep track of all the items they buy, albeit monthly or weekly, which may give detailed insights to limit future expenses.
Example: analysing the average consumption life of an item like peanut butter, could help you determine how important the item is to your household, how it is used and if it is being used as efficiently or sparingly as possible and not wasted without much thought.
